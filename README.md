# Welcome to the xthedrew website
Hi, and welcome to the open-source repository of my new rewritten [website](https://xtdrew.xyz)! This website is made with vite (vue-ts).

-------------

### Frequently Asked Questions
##### Who is xthedrew?
xtdrew (or xthedrew) is a programmer who develops web applications and games (currently in Haxe). He is also known as a music artist named [LayreBoi](https://next.layreboi.me).

##### Where did you get your name?
I've got my name xthedrew a long time ago, since 2016. My name was chosen by my older sister after she made an account for a popular [rhythm game](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8132588) for me. After a while, it hasn't been used until a few months after LayreBoi, where I reused the name as a developer name.

##### Why did you choose xthedrew instead of LayreBoi?
I didn't feel like using LayreBoi as a developer name, so I kept it just a music artist name.

##### How should I call you?
You can just call me Layre.
